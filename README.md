# BlockchainIdentityVerifier

## Description

A decentralized ledger framework leveraging zk-SNARKs for scalable privacy-preserving transactions, integrated with a novel Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus algorithm for high-throughput and robust network resilience.

## Features

- Here are 7 technical features for a BlockchainIdentityVerifier software project:
- "Authenticates identities using decentralized public key infrastructure (DPKI) with selfsovereign identity (ERC725) standards",
- "Verifies identity claims through zeroknowledge proof protocols (zkSNARKs) for enhanced privacy",
- "Integrates with various blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, and Corda, for broad compatibility",
- "Employs machine learningbased anomaly detection to identify potential identity fraud",
- "Supports decentralized storage solutions, such as IPFS, for secure and decentralized identity data storage",
- "Implements rolebased access control (RBAC) for finegrained permissioning and identity management",
- "Provides realtime identity verification status updates through WebSocketsbased eventdriven architecture"
## Installation

```bash
pip install blockchainidentityverifier
```

## Usage

```python
from blockchainidentityverifier import BlockchainIdentityVerifier

# Initialize
app = BlockchainIdentityVerifier()

# Run
app.run()
```
